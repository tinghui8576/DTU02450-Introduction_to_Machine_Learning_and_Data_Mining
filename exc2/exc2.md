### Attribute
* P.8
military rank: discrete ordinal
angles: continuous ratio
year of birth: discrete interval
age in years: discrete ratio
coat check number: discrete nominal
distance from center of campus: continuous ratio
number of patients:discrete ratio
### Outlier
* model the outliers
* identify & exclude outliers(always throw their with good reasons)
### Missing values
* remove
### Basis for space
a basis vector should be
* orthonormal(orthogonal and in unit length)
* linearly independent
### Projection
* P.40-42 need to read again[myself] (just linear algebra)
